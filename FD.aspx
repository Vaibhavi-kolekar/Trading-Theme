    <strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #2E3A59;">Fixed Deposits (FD)</strong><br><br>

    A Fixed Deposit (FD) is a financial instrument offered by banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) that allows investors to deposit money for a fixed period at a predetermined interest rate. It is one of the safest investment options for conservative investors who want assured returns and capital protection. <br><br>

    <strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #2E3A59;">Key Features of Fixed Deposits:</strong><br><br>

    • <strong>Capital Safety:</strong> Fixed Deposits are considered low-risk and offer safety of principal amount along with guaranteed returns. <br><br>

    • <strong>Fixed Interest Rate:</strong> Interest is fixed at the time of investment and remains unaffected by market fluctuations throughout the tenure. <br><br>

    • <strong>Flexible Tenure:</strong> Investors can choose a tenure ranging from 7 days to 10 years based on their financial goals and cash flow needs. <br><br>

    • <strong>Premature Withdrawal:</strong> Most banks allow premature withdrawal of FD funds, though a penalty on interest may apply. <br><br>

    • <strong>Loan Against FD:</strong> Many banks offer loans of up to 90% of the FD value, providing liquidity without breaking the deposit. <br><br>

    • <strong>Interest Payout Options:</strong> Interest can be received at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) or on maturity, based on investor preference. <br><br>

    • <strong>Taxation:</strong> Interest earned on FDs is taxable under the investor’s income tax slab. TDS is applicable if annual interest exceeds ₹40,000 (₹50,000 for senior citizens). <br><br>

    • <strong>Ideal for Risk-Averse Investors:</strong> Since returns are not linked to market performance, FDs are suitable for those looking for steady and secure returns. <br><br>

    In conclusion, Fixed Deposits provide financial stability, predictable income, and easy access to funds through loan facilities, making them a dependable choice for conservative investors or those seeking capital preservation.
