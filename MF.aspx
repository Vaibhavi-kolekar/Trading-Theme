    To many people, Mutual Funds can seem complicated or intimidating. We are going to try and simplify it for you at its very basic level. Essentially, the money pooled in by a large number of people (or investors) is what makes up a Mutual Fund. This fund is managed by a professional fund manager.<br><br>

    It is a trust that collects money from a number of investors who share a common investment objective. Then, it invests the money in equities, bonds, money market instruments and/or other securities. Each investor owns units, which represent a portion of the holdings of the fund. The income/gains generated from this collective investment is distributed proportionately amongst the investors after deducting certain expenses, by calculating a scheme’s Net Asset Value or NAV. Simply put, a Mutual Fund is one of the most viable investment options for the common man as it offers an opportunity to invest in a diversified, professionally managed basket of securities at a relatively low cost.

    <strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #2E3A59;">How Does a Mutual Fund Work?</strong><br><br>

    A mutual fund pools money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of securities as per Scheme Offer Documents. Let's break down how a mutual fund works. <br><br>

    The pooling of funds is done when investors contribute money to the mutual fund scheme in the form of units. Each unit represents a proportionate ownership in the fund, and its underlying assets. The objective of the fund would follow a specific investment strategy, and determine the kinds of securities the fund will invest in and it is subject to market risks. <br><br>

    Mutual fund schemes usually invest in a broad range of securities to diversify risks. The fund manager would actively manage the portfolio, make decisions on buying, holding or selling the underlying securities according to their research and analysis. Passive mutual funds mirror the performance of a market index to maximise returns. The portfolio of a passive fund replicates a designated market index, such as Nifty or Sensex, with the composition and proportion of investments matching the tracked index, subject to tracking error.
